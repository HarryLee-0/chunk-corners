# chunk-corners
Enter in your coordinates and it will provide the corners of the chunk. (The blocks mentioned are inside the chunk). Works on Minecraft Bedrock Edition.

#Example
This is an example of the terminal:

Input X:10
Input Z:10

Chunk Corners:
(15, 0, 15)
(15, 0, 0)
(0, 0, 0)
(0, 0, 15)

This means that coordinates in Chunk Corners are part of the chunk, but are the outmost blocks in the chunk you are in.
